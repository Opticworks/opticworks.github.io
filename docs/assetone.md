# ASSETone

::: info
ASSETone has not begun production yet as we are still focusing on Luatri. This is just a placeholder really.
:::

ASSETone is a GTK application that is used externally outside of Roblox Studio. Its multi-threaded integration with the Roblox AssetService API allows for much faster bulk-uploading, in case you have tons of assets (i.e. audios, images, textures, meshes, and others) that require uploading.

## First installation

Download it and install it at this beautiful repo here: (lol there is nothing to download as of yet)

### Logging in

The program will ask you to log in. Give me your username and password. Yesss. Do it.

## Usage

### Selecting group

The program will by default select yourself as the uploader, but you can instead select a group on the dropdown list where you wish to upload.

### Selecting files

Clicking "select files" will select files
