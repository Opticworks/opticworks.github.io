# DevTools

DevTools is the GUI used by VisTools to change and update certain game and script states. 

## Using DevTools

By default, DevTools checks if you're in Studio. If you are, you'll be able to toggle DevMode with the right `[CTRL]` key.

Once you've done so, you will get outputs on the lower left edge of the screen. You will also have a button in the middle-left side of your screen that you can click to open up the DevTools frame. Clicking it will bring up DevTools. 
From thereon you'll be able to close DevTools by clicking the X in the top right or by clicking the button in the middle-left.

And that's it! All your buttons and stuff will be in there :)
