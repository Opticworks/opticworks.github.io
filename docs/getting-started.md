# Getting started

This page will put you on the same wavelength as Opticworks and what it's up to.

## What even is Opticworks?

Opticworks is a mini-group of developers and friends working together to help make Roblox just that tiny bit better. It is a group started off in 2023 with me making frosted-glass or businessy style user interfaces that was applied to modern genre games until it saw its full potential as being able to work with almost any development tool.
We've been expanding over to scene management tooling, such as our own VisTools, to help optimize games in such a way that it allows for higher FPS and render efficiency.
