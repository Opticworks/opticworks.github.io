# Before You Buy

Pay attention to this section; this section contains all of the pros and cons of using Luatri.


## Who is this for?

Part of our mission statement for Luatri is to make it tick on every platform for every demographic. We have these fictional people to think about whenever we want to make or add something.


1. **Alice** - 8 years old - S10 - stupid kid

Alice is a girl who just started 2nd grade and made an account on Roblox because all of her friends are on it. She plays with them at home with her mom's S10. She doesn't really notice much but will get annoyed if FPS is low.


2. **Bob** - 13 years old - 6700K, 1050Ti - less stupid kid

Bob is a kid who got a second-hand PC as a gift from his parents for doing a good job with his grades. He gets bullied at school because of his weird name and thus tends to spend as much time as he can on his PC. Bob pays attention to his FPS and will try his best to get more than 60 at all times.


3. **Charlie** - 16 years old - 12900k, 3060 - developer

Charlie has just passed his GCSE's with flying colours and got this awesome, capable PC as a result. It's a huge step up from the laptop he got from his communion. This was his chance to stop being a critic and start being a creator. He has about 2 months of Studio experience and has just come across Luatri.


4. **Dan** - 25 years old - PS5 - casual

Dan saved up enough money from work to get a PS5 to pair alongside his 4K TV. Unfortunately no games are made for the PS5 and it's either cashgrab remakes or remasters or it's Roblox, and he chose the latter. He spends his downtime playing basically whatever games the PS5 version of Roblox will support. He will think that whatever happens on screen is meant and programmed to happen.


5. **Ellie** - 26 years old - 9950X, 7900XTX - seasoned developer

As a player, Ellie has sharp senses and a wide peripheral vision and gets hackusated somewhat often.
As a developer, she has 12 years of experience under her belt. She is a Studio poweruser and has a keen eye for not just FPS, but 1% and 0.1% lows, and scene drawcalls and tricounts. She will also notice objects popping in and out inexplicably.



Ok, why should we care about these 5 people? They are mostly divided into 2 separate categories; the players (A,B,D) and the developers (C,E, and even you!) We want to make Luatri be easy to work with, and that includes having a "low skill ceiling" of sorts. You should not be banished from using Luatri simply because you don't have enough experience. All Luatri asks from you is basic understanding of Studio and its tools.

## The Pros

Because why would you want to bother with something that doesn't have any pros?

### Free & Open-Source

Luatri does not require the contents of your wallet or bank account. Being open-source, Luatri itself can be optimized to the limits of the Roblox engine by many talented developers; not just us. This is especially useful to C and E.

### Performance & Efficiency First

Luatri is built to be as fast as possible. We notice every small detail and keep code changes in if they're more performant than previous versions - even if it means gains of a hundredth of a millisecond. This helps A B, and D immensely where performance is limited.

### Frequent Updates

Updates are frequently pushed to help make Luatri even better.

## The Cons

### Luatri is not magic.

Yes, unfortunately this is the sad truth and I wish that weren't the case too. In order for Luatri to really shine through you will also have to help your game get a bit more breathing room; and this mostly applies to CPU usage, but also GPU usage, hand-in-hand.

### Luatri doesn't have any cool plugins... yet

Plugins are not that high up in the priority list. For now, setting tags manually in the Explorer and Properties tab is good enough. Neither are drawcall heatmaps (as of now...) This hinders C's speed at getting to use Luatri.. which sucks.
