# Setting up distance fading

::: info
 This section is a stub. It will be expanded later on.
:::

Distance fading is the act of having small details fade out when they contribute very little to any certain scene or frame.

## Setup

The quickest way is usually by pressing `[CTRL]` + `[F]` to search for your props, selecting them all, and adding the tag `Detail_Small` to them.

You can change the range at which details are faded in and out in `luatri_config` in ReplicatedStorage. The relevant variable is `DISTANCE_FADING_RANGE` (default is 200.)
