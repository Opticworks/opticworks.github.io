# Setting up
::: warning
 Trying to use Luatri with `StreamingEnabled` during the initial development phase is **not supported** and can and will break Luatri.
:::

## First installation

The install is as follows:
1. Go to the [release page](https://github.com/Opticworks/Luatri/releases).
2. Download the .rbxm file.
3. Drag the .rbxm file into your game and follow the instructions.

Your game now has Luatri! The explorer structure should now look like this:

```
. 
├ StarterGUI
│ └ DGUI
└ StarterPlayer
   └ StarterPlayerScripts
      ├ DevTools
      └ Luatri
```

## Ok, so what now?

Now you just start setting up stuff that makes your FPS go up!
